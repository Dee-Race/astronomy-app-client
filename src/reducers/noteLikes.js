// should return state + 1

// An ACTION is a JavaScript object that describes a change that we want to make.
// type property: "INCREMENT_LIKES", and the value needs to be a string
// always returns state as the fallback case

// action -> reducer -> new state
// reducer function must be "pure" - cannot modify its arguments
