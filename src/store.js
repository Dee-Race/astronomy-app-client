// With Redux you have ONE big STORE which is a JS object
// Never mutating the data in the store, only creating new versions of this object
// You have a full history of where the store started when the app initially started and every change along the way

// The store is responsible for both maintaining the state and accepting actions from the view
// Only the store has access to the reducer
// All of the application's data is in a single data structure called the state which is held in the store.

// The app reads the state from the store
// State is never mutated directly outside the store
// The View's display the actions that describe what happened
// Use Dispatch to send the actions to the store
// A new state is created by combining old state and the action by a function called the reducer
